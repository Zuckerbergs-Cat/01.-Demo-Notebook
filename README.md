# 01.-Demo-Notebook
This is the Jupyter Notebook shown in the [Youtube demo](https://youtu.be/9dsDgcxeWgQ).
\
It automates logging in, finding a specific user, opening the user's follower list and scrolling through the list.
\
This has been tested on Linux. If you have Windows or MacOS, please try running it and then [DM](https://www.instagram.com/murage_kibicho/) or email to let me know if it works!
\
Have fun!
